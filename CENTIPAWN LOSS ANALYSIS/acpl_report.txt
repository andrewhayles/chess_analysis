What is ACPL?
---
Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL) is a metric used to measure the accuracy of chess moves.
A "centipawn" is 1/100th of a pawn. ACPL represents the average number of centipawns
you lost per move compared to the engine's best move. A lower ACPL means your moves
were closer to the computer's top choices, indicating higher accuracy.

Practical ACPL Tiers (Perspective):
---
These ranges are approximations, particularly for games with faster time controls,
but they provide a useful reference point for self-assessment.

- 10-20:  Super Grandmaster (2700+ Elo): World-class precision, frequently dropping
          into single digits in top-level matches.

- 20-25:  Grandmaster (2500-2700 Elo): Exceptional consistency and a low
          frequency of significant errors.

- 25-35:  Master (2200-2400 Elo): Strong, professional-level play, indicating
          a solid performance.

- 30-60:  Expert / Club Player (1800-2200 Elo): Represents strong amateur and
          tournament players. Averages in the 50s and 60s are common,
          especially in faster time controls.

- 60-120: Intermediate Player (1200-1800 Elo): A typical range for the large
          cohort of intermediate players. Games are often decided by more
          obvious tactical mistakes.

- 100+:   Novice / Beginner (<1200 Elo): Fundamental blunders are common. Scores
          of 150 or higher are commonplace. An ACPL over 300 suggests a player
          is very new to the game.

Note: These ranges are approximate and can be affected by the complexity of the games,
time control, and the depth of the analysis engine.
