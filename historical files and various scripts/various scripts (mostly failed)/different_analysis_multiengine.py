# chess_analyzer_multi_engine_depth.py
# A script to analyze PGN chess games and estimate a specific player's rating.
# This version uses a sophisticated multi-engine, depth-based approach to
# achieve a high R-squared correlation.
#
# KEY FEATURES:
#   1. REAL ENGINE PANEL: Uses a CSV file of real engines with known ratings to
#      generate high-quality, non-random data for the performance model.
#   2. AVERAGED GROUND TRUTH: An "oracle panel" of the strongest engines provides
#      an averaged evaluation for each position, creating a stable baseline.
#   3. MOVE QUALITY METRIC: A nuanced (0.0-1.0) score based on weighted centipawn
#      loss provides a richer signal than a simple hit/miss system.
#   4. DEPTH-BASED ANALYSIS: Uses search depth instead of time for consistent effort.
#   5. STABLE & INTERACTIVE: Uses a fault-tolerant, isolated process model and
#      is fully interactive and resumable.
