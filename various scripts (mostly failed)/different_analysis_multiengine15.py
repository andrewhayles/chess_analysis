# chess_analyzer_multi_engine_robust_cpl_fix.py
# A script to analyze PGN chess games and estimate a specific player's rating.
# This version corrects a critical bug in the Centipawn Loss (CPL) calculation.
#
# KEY IMPROVEMENTS (from previous version):
#   1. CPL CALCULATION FIX: Corrected a major logical flaw where move quality was
#      calculated by comparing scores from mismatched points of view. Both the
#      engine modeling and player analysis now correctly compare scores from the
#      same player's perspective, leading to accurate quality scores.
#   2. PARTIAL ANALYSIS: If an engine fails or times out mid-game, the script
#      now uses the data from the moves it successfully completed.
#   3. UNICODE ERROR HANDLING: Catches `UnicodeDecodeError` from engines with
#      non-standard startup messages, preventing crashes.
#   4. GRANULAR SAVING & SEAMLESS RESUME.
